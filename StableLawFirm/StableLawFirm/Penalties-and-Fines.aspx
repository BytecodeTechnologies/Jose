           According to the law, driving is a privilege, not a right. If you are not taking driving seriously, then it is surely not wrong if government snatch this privilege from you. It can also result in suspended or revoked license resulting in fines and even imprisonment. The seriousness of your violations - and resulting penalties - are tracked by MVC using a point system. For every violation committed by you MVC give you points on your driving record. The more point you will collect, more harsh penalties you will have to face. Your points also affect your insurance price. If you have collected more points, your insurance will go on a sky-high rate
        </p>

        <h4 class="suspendedtabmargin">How these points affect you?</h4>
                            <p>Effect on insurance:  Getting points on your license can increase your insurance rates. If you want to keep your premiums cheap then you must keep your driving record clean without points. You must contact your insurance agent for details in case you have collected more than 6 points on your driving record.</p>
       <p><b>Effect on license:</b>   On the off chance that you get 12 or more points on your present driving record, your license will be suspended. You will get a notification of planned suspension via mail.</p>
                            <p><b>Surcharges:</b>  If you got excessive points on your driving record, it may cause you to pay additional charges to NJMVC. Surcharges are the additional fines assessed by <a href="Points-and-Surcharges.aspx">New Jersey Surcharge</a> Violation System (NJSVS). These surcharges are collected on an annual basis from the drivers who have collected excessive points on their driving records.</p>
                            <h6>In what manner would I be able to dispose of points from my record? </h6>
                            <p>In spite of the fact that MVC keeps a permanent record of the number of points you've earned, it is possible to gain points deductions by keeping your driving record clean for a few years or by not breaking the traffic laws again. Another best way to cut off points from your record is to go through traffic/safety school approved by MVC. You can contact us for more details now!
