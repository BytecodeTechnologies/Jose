                                We all know, reckless driving thrills but kills. No doubt, if you are driving recklessly, you are not only putting your own life in danger, but others life too. Almost everybody drives recklessly today either due to anxiety or hurry or for experiencing thrill or adventure. It's easy to call other people a jerk, if he or she is driving recklessly, but to put serious driving into practice, is a tedious task for every one of us. Your driving is considered as reckless not only when you are at high speed, but also when you are engaged in other activities while driving such as talking on a cell phone, putting on makeup, or any of the thousand other things that divert your full attention on the road.

                                Luckily, because of strict traffic rules and regulations in New Jersey most of the people get their wake-up call before they injure themselves, someone else, or wreck someone's property. But the unfortunate part of that wake-up call is that it usually comes in the form of getting issued a <a href="Careless-Driving.aspx">careless</a> or reckless driving traffic ticket.

                                Reckless driving N.J.S.A. 39:4-96 is an intense violation in light of the fact that the scope of punishments is higher than most other moving violations. The violation gives five motor vehicles and five insurance points to the driver, up to $200 fine or up to 60 days in jail for the first offense and up to three months in jail for a second or subsequent offense. The license suspension can range from 1 to 90 days for a first offence. For the second and subsequent offence, the suspension can range from 1 to 180 days.
