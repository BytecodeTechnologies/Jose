Speeding tickets are given to slow down all of the road blusters and all of the aggressive drivers. Officers who issue speeding tickets usually measures the speed with radar. In New Jersey, a speeding ticket of 1 to 14 miles over the cutoff is a 2 point offense. A speeding ticket of 15 to 29 is a 4-point offense.
