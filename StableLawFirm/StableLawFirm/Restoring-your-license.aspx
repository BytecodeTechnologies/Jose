                            <p>The traffic ticket is a growing market now-a-days and if you got a <a href="Traffic-Ticket.aspx"> traffic ticket in NJ</a>, it becomes necessary to hire an attorney for fighting your case. An experienced NJ traffic lawyer can even dismiss your traffic ticket since they know the technicalities of the cases. Traffic ticket legal advisors give their whole practice to traffic tickets. So in the event that you got a traffic ticket, hiring a good traffic legal counselor is the most ideal approach to manage it. Following are the ways in which they can help you:</p>
                            <p>
                                <b>They can help you in saving your money: </b>

                                If you simply pay your ticket without fighting in court, it means that you are admitting guilt and it will be counted as a conviction on your record, which can become the cause of many problems. If you have many points on your driving record, you have to pay Surcharges to the NJMVC. Surcharges are additional fines charged by NJMVC to the drivers who do not have a clean driving record. 
       
                            </p>
                            <p>Along with surcharges, points can also increase your insurance bill. By reducing your points, your savings can be good and you’ll be able to have a clean driving record. Your insurance company will use your vehicle history to calculate your insurance premium. If you accumulate points for violations, your insurance rates can be drastically expanded. Insurance agencies consistently check their clients' driving records and increment insurance premiums in the event that they discover a ticket on a client's record. </p>


                            <p><b>They can help you in saving your license:</b> According to New Jersey laws, your license may be suspended if you accumulate 12 points or more on your current driving record. Also, if you have committed any major traffic or criminal offence like <a href="Dui-Dwi-Defense-Lawyers.aspx"> DUI or DWI in New Jersey</a>, your license will be suspended immediately.</p>
