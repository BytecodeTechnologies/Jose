                                Perhaps, you may not be aware of this fact, but when you get a traffic ticket, you enter the abstruse trap of your nearby municipal or county traffic court. And for an individual it is not an easy task to come out of this trap without the help of an experienced lawyer. Just like almost every <a href="about-us.aspx">traffic lawyer in New Jersey</a>, our Firm has no interest at all in whether you're blameless or blameworthy. Our work is to find out every small detail about your traffic ticket and our goal is to defend you in the best possible way. 

                            </p>
                            <p>For a traffic lawyer, it is significantly more vital to know who ticketed you and at which location because that decides the court in which your case will be called. The severity of your case will also depend on whether your offence is a criminal or traffic offence. For example, driving under influence (DUI) is a criminal offence of operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration that exceeds the legal limit and a <a href="Speeding-Tickets.aspx">speeding ticket</a> is a traffic offence of driving with a speed that is above the legal speed limit.</p>
                            <p>A traffic ticket is really a terrible trap, and that's why to get rid of this 9 out of 10 traffic offenders simply pay the ticket rather than fighting it in court. But if you pay your ticket, it counts as a conviction on your record which can cause your insurance rates too costly and can also result in a suspended license and surcharges if you got other points on your driving record in future.</p>
                            <h4>

                            </h4>
                            <p>Yes, surely they can dismiss your traffic ticket. Because they know the technicalities of the cases, sometimes they deal with hundreds of tickets per day. Traffic ticket lawyers devote their entire practice to traffic tickets. So if you got a traffic ticket, hiring a good traffic lawyer is the best possible way to deal with it.</p>
