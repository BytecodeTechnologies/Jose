                <p>Got caught while driving with a suspended license? The Stable Law Firm can help you in the best possible way. We know, that with a specific end goal to demonstrate that a driver is blameworthy of driving on the revoked list the prosecutor must demonstrate two crucial components. Firstly, the prosecutor must prove in the court that the driver was actually operating the vehicle. He can only prove this thing by the statement of a police officer who caught the culprit and usually the police officer fails to appear in the court. And secondly, we put the burden of proof on the State! The proof of suspension papers and the proof of mailings from the MVC. Usually opposition fails to obtain these items as a result of which the case can be sorted out. But definitely you will require an experienced lawyer for representing your case in the court. We have many years of combined experience in such cases and our lawyers are some of the most experienced in the State of New Jersey. </p>
                <h6>There could be following reasons that can lead to suspension of license in New Jersey:</h6>
                <ul class="ulclass">
                    <li class="tab_li">Failure to pay <a href="Points-and-Surcharges.aspx"> surcharges</a></li>
                    <li class="tab_li">If you got 12 or more points on your current driver record</li>
                    <li class="tab_li">Failure to pay fines or appear in court</li>
                    <li class="tab_li">Driving with a suspended license</li>
                    <li class="tab_li">Drug or alcohol use while driving</li>
                    <li class="tab_li">Reckless or careless driving</li>
                    <li class="tab_li">Vehicle abandonment on a public highway</li>
                    <li class="tab_li">Physical or mental disqualification</li>
                    <li class="tab_li">Failure to provide proof of insurance</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="suspendedtabmargin">Driving While Suspended</h4>
                <p>
                    If you got caught again and are aware of your license being suspended, you must not share this information with the police officer. According to NJSA 39:3-40, no individual whose driving privilege has been suspended or terminated or who has been restricted from obtaining a driving license, should operate a motor vehicle.
