                                Knowing your limits when it comes to alcohol is very important, Especially when you are driving in a state like New Jersey. The State of New Jersey has strict laws for the drunk driving, and when you drink and drive in New Jersey, you risk your privileges, finances and your future. An individual is blameworthy of drunk driving in the event if he/she operates a vehicle with a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.08 percent or more noteworthy. BAC alludes to the measure of liquor in your blood. In spite of the fact that the law alludes to a 0.08 percent BAC, you can be declared guilty of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor even when your BAC is below 0.08 percent.

                            <h4 class="suspendedtabmargin">Refusal test are serious offenses</h4>
                            <p>If you refused to take a breath test in New Jersey, then it will be considered as a very serious offence and can impart more penalties in your case. On your first offense, you will be subjected to a fine of $300-$500 and a license suspension of not less than seven months or more than one year. On 2nd offense, the fine will increase to $500-$1,000 and a 2-year license suspension. They may refer you to an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center. Therefore, you must never refuse to submit a Breathalyzer test. However, there are many DUI defense strategies that can be used to undermine the results of BAC testing. Your lawyer must be aware of all these strategies in order to save you from harsh penalties.
