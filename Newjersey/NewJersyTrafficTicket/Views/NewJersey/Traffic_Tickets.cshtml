            <img src="~/Content/NJ_Images/traffic-ticket.jpg" class="img-responsive img-circle"  alt="New Jersey Traffic Ticket Lawyer"/>. State troopers are giving traffic tickets at a record pace, even for 5 mph over the speed limits. All traffic tickets in New Jersey have a section number and you should take into consideration how many points a traffic ticket comes with. According to the New Jersey point system, at 6 Points you will be on probation and at 12 points you will lose your license! Troopers are now giving multiple traffic tickets in one stopping which may result in losing your license if you do not dismiss the tickets or at the very least reduce the points.
