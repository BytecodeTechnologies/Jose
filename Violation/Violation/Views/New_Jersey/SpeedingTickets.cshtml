    <h4>New Jersey Speeding Ticket Attorneys</h4>
    <p>
        Speeding Tickets are often issued by state troopers who use radar and many people assume that they must pay the fine because they 
          think they are guilty. The Stabile Law Firm wins radar speeding tickets in NJ, even if you know or think you are guilty 
          of speeding and were caught on radar. Our law firm has represented over 100,000 cases for traffic ticket in Woodbridge 
          and other NJ townships, and the majority of those traffic violations were speeding tickets. In addition to this, our 
          four (4) traffic ticket lawyers have over 25 years of combined experience winning speeding tickets, even if they were 
          issued using radar! Speeding tickets are the most common type of traffic tickets given in New Jersey and New York.  
          However, most of the time, multiple traffic tickets are issued in addition to the speeding ticket. State troopers are 
          known to give speeding tickets even for going 5mph over the speed limit. Generally the faster you speed the more points
           will be associated to the speeding ticket. New Jersey has four grouped speeding tickets into 3 categories:
    </p>
    <p><b>2 Point Speeding Tickets</b></p>
    <p>Exceeding maximum speed 1-14 mph over limit</p>
    <p><b>4 Point Speeding Tickets</b></p>
    <p>Exceeding maximum speed 15-29 mph over limit</p>
    <p><b>5 Point Speeding Tickets</b></p>
    <p>Exceeding maximum speed 30 mph or more over limit</p>
